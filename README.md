# ID3rw

> PHP-Library for reading and writing ID3-Tags.

> ⚠ The Library yet only supports Version 2.4.0.

> ℹ The library is in early development stage, but if possible the current API (public methods) will not change.


## Example

```php
// Read frames from file.
$reader = new \Rhorber\ID3rw\Reader('/home/user/myfile.mp3');
$frames = $reader->getFrames();
print_r($frames);

// Change title.
$frames['TIT2']['content'] = '2018-10-21_'.$frames['TIT2']['content'];

// Write a new file (with modified title).
$writer = new \Rhorber\ID3rw\Writer();
$writer->writeNewFiel($frames, '/home/user/mynewfile.mp3');
```

## TODO

Features I will add:
* Support more versions (at least V2.3.0).
* Improve parsing of non-text frames.
* Return detailed info about frames (not only technical name).
* Improve readme.


## About/History

I needed a library for modifying some ID3-Tags.
I did not find any library for doing that (getid3 was not able to write correctly),
so I started writing my own in plain PHP.
